My goal is to help SMBs keep money in their pockets, instead of being exploited year after year by price hikes, shady business practices, or contracts that result from tools being swallowed up by giant corporations like <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.kaseya.com/press-release/kaseya-acquires-datto/">Kaseya</a>, <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aussie-born-gluh-rebranded-to-datto-commerce-561663">Datto</a>, <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.channelfutures.com/channel-business/connectwise-ceo-we-re-on-the-acquisition-trail">Connectwise</a>, and <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/scalepad-acquires-quoter-to-automate-it-sales-quoting-contract-management">ScalePad</a>.</p>
