            <p class="mb-2">This project will stay open-source, independent, and focused on the needs of ICT consultants and growing MSPs.</p> 
            <p>
                It will always be community-oriented, open, and supportive. My goal is to help SMBs keep money in their pockets, instead of being exploited year after year by price hikes, shady business practices, or contracts that result from tools being swallowed up by giant corporations like <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.kaseya.com/press-release/kaseya-acquires-datto/">Kaseya</a>, <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aussie-born-gluh-rebranded-to-datto-commerce-561663">Datto</a>, <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.channelfutures.com/channel-business/connectwise-ceo-we-re-on-the-acquisition-trail">Connectwise</a>, and <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/scalepad-acquires-quoter-to-automate-it-sales-quoting-contract-management">ScalePad</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with getting paid and making money, but rarely does an acquisition benefit the end-user and that is ultimately what I wish to avoid.
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="mt-12 font-bold underline underline-offset-2">That all sounds great, but how will this project survive?</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">To sustain the project, I plan to focus on three key avenues:</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Sponsorships</h3>
                    <p class="my-2">I'm looking for sponsors who believe in the project and want to support its growth. Sponsorships will help keep the project running, ensuring it always aligns with the needs of the community.</p>
