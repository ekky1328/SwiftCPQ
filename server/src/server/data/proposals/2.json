As part of this proposal, we are recommending the setup of a robust, on-premises solution with physical handsets, an integrated SIP Trunk, and two dedicated channels (lines) for seamless and reliable communication.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, we will be providing a new internet connection to replace your existing Telstra services. This will ensure a more reliable and high-performance internet experience, designed to fully support the needs of your communication system.</p><p><br></p><p>The proposed 3CX Phone System is an advanced, yet easy-to-manage platform that supports voice, video, and messaging services. By combining it with the latest hardware and reliable SIP Trunking technology, we aim to deliver a cost-effective solution that improves your business’s ability to stay connected, whether in the office or remotely.</p><p><br></p><p>We are confident that this proposal will not only meet your technical needs but will also streamline communication across your organization, improving productivity and collaboration. Should you have any questions or require further details, I am happy to discuss the specifics at your convenience.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to working together on this project and delivering a solution tailored to your business’s requirements.</p>",
